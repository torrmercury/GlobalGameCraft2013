You are trapped in a non-Euclidean room and there is a single doorway.
In order to get out, you must get to the doorway without looking away from the door.
The room itself is fighting against you and trying to make you look away because when you do,
the doorway moves.

Various parts of the room does different things
treadmills, rotations, pillars may rise up, bouncy surface,
reverse gravity, lights on or off except for the door, cam shaking,
trapdoor to a different space in the room (chains sound like opening castle door), 

Levels: ramp up difficulty as we go.

Art style: even light (ambient with spotlights), dark steampunk style, steam particle effects, 

Coding work: randomize doorways, make sure doors donâ€™t spawn close to player
